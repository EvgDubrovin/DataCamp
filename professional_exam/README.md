## What's going on here?
Here is the Sales Strategy analysis for an office stationery company made for a DataCamp professional analyst certification exam.

The stack I used: *pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, jupyter notebook* and *Google Slides*.

*sales_pro_exam.ipynb* - the data exploration  
*Presentation_SalesStrategyAnalysis* - a report with the analysis results.
